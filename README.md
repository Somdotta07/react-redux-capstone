# REACT-REDUX-CAPSTONE
### This React capstone project is about building a mobile web application to check a list of metrics (numeric values) that you will create making use of React and Redux.

We will select an API that provides numeric data about a topic that you like and then build the webapp around it. The webapp will have several pages:

 - one page with a list of items that could be filtered by some parameters; This page should be your homepage.
 - one page for the item details;
